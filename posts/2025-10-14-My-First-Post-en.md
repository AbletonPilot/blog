## Why Create a Blog?

AI has advanced so much that creating projects and artwork has become incredibly accessible. (Yay!)

However, it feels like the internet world I once knew has changed significantly.

What I'm trying to say isn't that AI is ruining the internet, but rather **the people who use AI** seem to be degrading it.

Of course, I also use AI to create projects and images, and I play around with it on my own. But when some people try to create everything with AI, instead of quality projects and content, we get meaningless or misleading content flooding the ocean of information.

It feels like the ocean is being polluted with garbage.

(Soon, AI-generated content might be dismissed as internet trash...)

## So What's This Blog About?

**I'm going to do whatever I want.**

Sometimes it'll be posts that someone needs, sometimes posts that are useless to others, sometimes useful facts I've learned, posts I can reference later, etc...

As mentioned above, with AI-generated content dominating the internet, it feels harder to find reliable information. So I'm going to try to write the most accurate information possible, or even when using AI, share information based on multiple trial-and-error experiences.

This is my first blog post, and since it's my first time creating blog content, I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. I don't know how many people will read this or find it helpful, but I'm trying to create a space that feels like my own. :)

Since I can't just end it here, let me show off my PC specs and wrap up this first post.
