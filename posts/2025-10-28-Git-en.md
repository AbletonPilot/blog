## A World Without git

![git](https://pub-9fab8c462d8d4428bf45385586df9f1a.r2.dev/thumbnail.png)

If we lived in a world without git, software development and internet services would be far more primitive than they are today. When Linus Torvalds and the Linux team were developing Linux, they were using BitKeeper, which ended its free service. This led them to develop git, which has become an indispensable tool for the internet worldâ€”something even they probably didn't foresee.

Before git, the 'centralized system' where code on a single server was modified has evolved into a 'decentralized system' where code is modified and merged on individual computers. This makes it easier to identify the root cause of problems and revert to previous states during software development, improving code stability and quality. In server operations and deployment, git enables infrastructure configuration management as code, change history tracking, and deployment automation.

So, what exactly is github?

## Are git and github Different?

![git and github](https://pub-9fab8c462d8d4428bf45385586df9f1a.r2.dev/image3-5.png)

git is a distributed version control system. It tracks and manages source code change history, allowing you to revert to previous versions of code or check changes at specific points in time.

github is a web-based service that hosts git repositories. It's a platform where you can store and share projects managed with git online. As long as you have internet access, it helps you share project code and collaborate with others.

To explain it in a table:

| git         | github         |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Software       | Service            |
| CLI         | GUI            |
| Runs on local system | Web-based, runs online |
| Linux       | Microsoft      |
| Distributed version control    | git repo hosting   |

In short, you do the actual work with git, and github allows you to visually check your git work and perform git operations through the web.

## How to Use

![how to use git command](https://pub-9fab8c462d8d4428bf45385586df9f1a.r2.dev/git_commands.png)

While you can work directly through github, switching between the web and your editor is inefficient, so it's more efficient to open a terminal in your editor and work there. Let's now explore frequently used git commands.

### Initial Setup and Workflow

The initial setup to connect git and github locally is as follows. Note that I'll also explain how to set up both github and gitlab if you use both.

```bash
// Install git
sudo pacman -S git        // Arch Linux
sudo apt install git      // Ubuntu
sudo dnf install git      // Fedora
winget install git.git    // Windows
choco install git         // Chocolatey
brew install git          // Mac

// Set global user information
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

// Verify user information
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

```bash
// Generate SSH keys
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "yourgithub@email.com"
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "yourgitlab@email.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_gitlab

// Create SSH config file and set permissions
touch ~/.ssh/config
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config

// Create and edit SSH config file
Host github.com               // github configuration (existing)
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519       // Existing github key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
       
Host gitlab.com               // gitlab configuration (newly added)
    HostName gitlab.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_gitlab // New gitlab key
    IdentitiesOnly yes

// Add keys to SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

// Add both keys
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519         // github key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_gitlab  // gitlab key

// Verify added keys
ssh-add -l

// View key contents
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_gitlab.pub
```

After this, register your SSH key with github/gitlab. You can register by accessing the respective site, then test if the SSH connection works properly.

```bash
// Verify connection
ssh -T git@github.com
ssh -T git@gitlab.com

// result
"Hi <your-github-username>! You've successfully authenticated..."  // github
"Welcome to gitlab, @<your-gitlab-username>!"                      // gitlab
```


Now github (gitlab) is connected to your computer. Let's see how to connect your project to github. 

```bash
// If you want to create a github repo through CLI, install
sudo pacman -S github-cli        // Arch Linux
winget install github.cli        // Windows
choco install github-cli         // Chocolatey
brew install gh                  // Mac
```

```bash
// Ubuntu, Debian
(type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install wget -y)) \
&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
&& out=$(mktemp) && wget -nv -O$out https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& cat $out | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/sources.list.d \
&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
&& sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt install gh -y
	

// Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat (DNF4)
sudo dnf install 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://cli.github.com/packages/rpm/gh-cli.repo
sudo dnf install gh --repo gh-cli
```

Now you've completed all the computer setup for git and github. Next, let's check the flow of creating a repo using git and gh commands and uploading to the remote repository.

```bash
// Initialize project
git init

// Add current files to staging area
git add .

// Add description for added files and update HEAD pointer in local repository
git commit -m "init"

// Check status
git status

// If branch name is master but you want to change it to main
git branch -m master main

// Check again
git status

// Create github repo (requires github CLI / private, use current directory source, set remote repository)
gh repo create repo-name --private --source=. --remote=origin

// Push to remote repository
git push -u origin main

// From now on, it's simple
git add .
git commit -m "fixed: type error"
git push
```

### reset and revert

If the uploaded code might be misleading to other team members or if the code modifications are insufficient, you need to go back. 
Even in such cases, you can work with the following commands.

First, there's the method of completely resetting without any history. 

```bash
// To go back to the previous state
git reset --hard HEAD~1

// How to push modified code afterwards
git push --force origin <branch-name>

// Or if collaborators haven't updated yet (recommended)
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>
```

Additionally, we used `--hard`, but there are three modes, so let's check them out

```bash
// Move only HEAD pointer (keep staging area as is)
git reset --soft <commit-hash>

// Move HEAD pointer and staging area (default)
git reset --mixed <commit-hash>

// Move HEAD pointer, staging area, and working directory
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

Second, there's the method of preserving history but creating a new commit that undoes the changes. Note that it creates a commit rather than reverting. 
Most people think of `revert` as just a 'reverting command', but in reality, it reverts by creating a new commit, modifying it, and committing again.

```bash
// Cancel most recent commit changes and create a new commit
git revert HEAD

// Cancel specific commit changes and create a new commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Therefore, use `reset` when you want to "make it as if it never happened locally", and use `revert` when you want to "cancel already shared changes and record them as new work". 
Note that `git reset --hard` cannot be recovered, so use it carefully.

### checkout and branch

Many people confuse `checkout` and `branch` commands. Simply put, `checkout` is used to switch the current working environment, while `branch` is a command that manages the branch itself, such as creating, listing, and deleting.

```bash
// Check local branches
git branch

// result
* main
dev
fix-login-function

// Check all branches
git branch -a

// result
* main
dev
fix-login-function
remotes/origin/fix-login-function
remotes/origin/fix-mobile-layout
remotes/origin/user-profile

// Create new branch
git branch admin-dashboard

// Delete branch
git branch -d new-login
```

```bash
// Switch workspace to dev
git checkout dev

// Create and move to a branch at the same time
git checkout -b payment
```

### tag

If you want to manage your project by version, create tags.

```bash
// Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "release v0.1.0"
git push

// Tag current commit and create
git tag v0.1.0

// Push tag to github
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Later, if you need to deploy again after adding or modifying features, create a new tag and push again.

```bash
// 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1

// Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "release v0.1.1"

// Create new tag
git tag v0.1.1

// push
git push origin v0.1.1
git push origin main
```

Tag management is also useful to know, so keep it in mind.

```bash
// Check list
git tag

// Checkout to specific tag
git checkout v0.1.0

// Delete tag (local)
git tag -d v0.1.0

// Delete tag (github)
git push origin --delete v0.1.0

// Add message to tag (optional)
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0: Initial release"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

### remote

You might also be confused about `remote`, but this command is a copy of a git repository that exists on a network, separate from your local computer's git repository. 
In short, when sharing company git code and working together, it acts as an **intermediate hub** between the company git repository and your computer's git repository.

Because of this, even if something goes wrong with your computer, the remote repository can prevent data loss, and as long as you have an internet connection, you can access and modify the project code.

You might think it's unfamiliar, but these are commands everyone uses, so let's check them out.

```bash
// When connecting a remote repository to a local repository
git remote add origin <repo>

// When copying the entire remote repository locally
git clone <repo>

// When uploading commits from local repository to remote repository
git push origin main

// When fetching commits from remote repository to local repository
git pull origin main

// When fetching changes from remote repository locally but not merging with current working branch
git fetch origin
```

This became too long, so although there are many gh commands, I only wrote about basic repo creation, and `diff` and `merge` also exist but were excluded from this post.

Honestly, you don't need to memorize all the commands explained. As you use them, you'll naturally learn them, and if you can't remember a feature you want, you can just search for it then without much problem. 
However, finding clear explanations for confusing parts like managing two SSH keys takes time, so I hope this post helps developers using git.

Finally, for those reading this, please don't buy books or courses about git and github on the market and just search for information yourself.
