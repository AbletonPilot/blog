# Getting Started with Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## Installation

To install Rust, run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Your First Program

Create a new file called `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

## Key Features

- **Memory Safety**: No null pointers or data races
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features without runtime overhead
- **Ownership System**: Unique approach to memory management
